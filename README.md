gmail-backup
============

Pieced together from other scripts to download the entire contents
of a gmail account for the purposes of a backup. 

There are other tools out there, but this does it exactly what I
want, mainly that it is not just an imap copy which can duplicate
messages due to a message having multiple labels.
